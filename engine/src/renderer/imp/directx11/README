Everything here is D3D11 related.
Notes:
1. One of the design principle is making the decision for users. Decisions are made for performance and easy of use. Thus sacrifice flexibility.
2. CPU should only write to resources if access is designed. Read access may be useful for debugging. Consider adding it later if desired.

TODO:
Figure out a way to handle multisampling render target and blending properly.
	Facts:
		- Multisampling in directx 11 is a loose feature which is hardware dependent.
		- Number of patterns for multisampling is fixed as well as number of samples. See here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff476218(v=vs.85).aspx
